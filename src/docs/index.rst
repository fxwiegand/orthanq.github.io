Orthanq: Uncertainty aware quantification of haplotypes
=======================================================

Orthanq is a tool that quantifies haplotypes in an uncertainty-aware manner. Two applications of haplotype quantification is offered by Orthanq. First application is the quantfication of HLA alleles at subclone resolution. This is possible for HLA typing of normal healthy samples and quantification of HLA haplotypes in tumor samples. Second application is the quantification of virus lineages in a virus mixture.
